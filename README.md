In this home lab, I will create a storage container for practice within a resource group on Azure.

1.	Create a Resource Group on Azure.

3.	Create a plain text file on your desktop and upload it to that Storage Container created in step 2.

5.	Delete the Resource group to ensure no cost is incurred.
